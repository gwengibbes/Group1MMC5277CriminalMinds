    <h1>Cast and Characters</h1>
    <div class="characters">
        <div class="character">
            <p>Criminal Minds tv series was created in 2005 and aired for 15 seasons. As with all tv shows,
                characters join, leave and at times come back for guest appearances or to rejoin for a few seasons. This
                show is no different. Some characters joined from inception and some joined towards the end of the
                show’s life but created a dynamic with the other characters that made the viewers think they had been
                there forever. The one detail that every character possessed was their ability to join the “family” of
                Criminal Minds. The family-feel that the show maintained throughout the 15 seasons was the glue that
                kept viewers hooked.</p>

                <p>Jason Gideon
                    Jason Gideon is played by Mandy Patinkin. Patinkin only lasted the first 2 seasons but set the stage
                    for future Behavioral Analysis Unit chiefs. He dealt with some of the most destructive and warped of
                    the protagonists, which mirrored the fact that his own character was suffering from mental health
                    issues. He left the show abruptly after a personal incident in the show. Although he wasn’t around
                    long, his legacy lived on through all 15 series. He was replaced by David Rossi.

                <p>David Rossi
                    David Rossi is played by Joe Mantegna. Mantegna is one of the complex characters of this group. He
                    grew up with a best friend who was a mobster, avoided crime and joined the army. He then joins the
                    FBI and eventually the BAU. He is also an author, albeit not a struggling one and has been married
                    many times. He is the one character who took a while to think of the BAU as his family. Once he
                    does, viewers get to see his gentle and compassionate side more frequently. When this happens, he
                    becomes ‘team dad,’ for the BAU, often inviting the team over for dinners.

                <p>Dr. Spencer Reid
                    Dr. Spencer Reid is played by Matthew Gray Gubler. Gubler joined the show from the first season and
                    was in the show for all 15 seasons. He was the youngest member of the team and although at times
                    perceived as geeky, he is the loveable genius “Spence.” His eidetic memory and his ability to make
                    connections to data helps the Behavioral Analysis Unit track down criminals. For many viewers he is
                    a favorite character.

                <p>Aaron Hotchner
                    Aaron Hotchner is played by Thomas Gibson. Gibson joined the show from the first season and stayed
                    for the first 12 seasons of the show. He is the ever serious chief of the Behavioral Analysis Unit
                    (BAU). He is a workaholic and this creates issues in his family life.

                <p>JJ - Jennifer Jareau
                    Jennifer Jareau is played by A.J. Cook and was commonly referred to as JJ. Often her full character
                    name is forgotten. She completed most seasons in the show, with the exception of season 6. She
                    starts the show as a liaison with the police force and eventually becomes a profiler in season 7.
                    She is the small town girl, who is hardworking but also viewed as gentle and sympathetic towards
                    others.

                <p>Penelope Garcia
                    Penelope Garcia, played by Kirstin Vangsness, is another long term Criminal Minds star. She has been
                    in all 15 seasons and is adored for her quirky style and cheerful disposition. Starting off her life
                    as a renowned criminal hacker, she now puts her genius to work to help catch the criminals. She has
                    a habit of filling her office with toys and trinkets that help her deal with the horrible images she
                    sees when researching the criminals that she and her team are chasing. She has a hard time dealing
                    with the crimes that she is faced with on a daily basis. Luckily she has her good friend Derek
                    Morgan to lean on.

                <p>Derek Morgan
                    Derek Morgan is played by Shemar Moore. He starred in Criminal Minds until season 11. His character
                    has many evolutions throughout the series. He joined the BAU as an ex-police officer who was
                    overeager and followed the rules to a T, often quoting regulations. He then evolved to the ladies’
                    man before settling on his serious, almost Hotchner-like attitude. Throughout these character
                    changes, he has consistently had a soft spot for his good friend Penelope, always making sure to
                    check in on her and coining her “Baby girl.” He has also consistently been the one person who
                    understands Reid’s jokes and this results in a close friendship for the pair.

                <p>Emily Prentiss
                    Emily Prentiss, played by Paget Brewster, has frequented Criminal Minds several times over the
                    course of the 15 seasons. She is the self acclaimed ‘nerd’ who works hard to hide her nerdiness. She
                    has lived all over the globe and thus speaks various languages. She is also quite skilled at chess
                    and it has been hinted that she is better at chess than Dr. Reid is! Prentiss is willing to put
                    herself at risk and seems to be able to manage the trauma that is thrown at her with supreme calm.
                    Although at times distant, she has managed to trust the members of the BAU.

                <p>Tara Lewis
                    Tara Lewis is played by Aisha Tyler. She joins the BAU team in season 11 as a forensic psychologist.
                    She is quiet and appears to be very serious. She initially seems to be quite standoffish with the
                    other team members but we eventually learn that she comes to the BAU with tons of baggage. From
                    being bullied in school to her mother dying of cancer to a brother who has chosen the wayward path
                    to having a husband who was addicted to drugs, she has seen it all. Couple that with having to deal
                    with psychopathic criminals regularly and one can understand the personality that Tara maintains.
                    Despite all these issues, Tara makes connections with the team and fits into the BAU family well.
